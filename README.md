## Time/Priority Matrix 

I planned my time as best I could, I didnt do a matrix because graphs make no sense to me and that would easily have taken me enough time that i'd have to add it to my timesheet.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
